# Measuring news bias with supervised deep learning
## Project as part of Slava Jankin and Hannah Bechara's Deep Learning Course

Newspapers are one of the most important institutions in contemporary democracies. They have the power to affect voting behaviour, as well as polarise the electorate or motivate them to turn out to vote. Therefore, it is surprising that few papers deploy sate-of-the-art Deep Learning technologies to classify ideological bias in news articles. We ﬁrst ﬁne-tune a transformer neural network on party press releases, which which is then applied and optimised to estimate ideological bias in news articles. We proceed to compare our model to an ambitious baseline model and prior accuracy scores in the literature.
